Hi $name,

Welcome to Assassins!

If you received two emails from me, please disregard the first one. I ran a script that included Paly's login link and rules. Do not use that or log in there, it will not work.

Your login username is $student_id
Your initial password is $initial_password

Please read over the rules here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_cmoWj-DkF0274RE5pxUxzs6_pJi3pW1vpk_VshQWDw/edit

There is a shorter version of the rules and safe zones here, for reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14qaXLkfrHLa6Ldm5WMCV4qxEvIbjIhZLXOnDLpsS28M/edit?usp=sharing

Sign into your elimination account at https://menlo-assassins.herokuapp.com/login

Changing your password is highly recommended. They are hashed, not stored in clear text (aka we can't see what your password is) so do not worry.

We will release targets at ~8 am on Tuesday, April 20th, and remember that the game starts at 9am so you are safe before first period starts, at least.

Have fun!

Best, Menlo Spirit Team
